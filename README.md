# Mapping the distribution of the White-tailed deer in Minnesota, using multi-criteria analysis and spatial disagregation in GRASS GIS

This tutorial is designed as a practical introduction to using GRASS GIS for suitability mapping of a species based on a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) approach. It uses the distribution of white-tailed deer as a case study. The tutorial aims to provide an accessible way to learn the principles of spatial analysis and decision-making workflows within GRASS GIS.

Through a structured, hands-on approach, you will learn how to use GRASS GIS to integrate various spatial data layers, apply multi-criteria analysis techniques, and generate meaningful insights about deer distribution patterns. While the white-tailed deer serves as the focal species, the skills and concepts presented are widely applicable to a range of ecological and spatial decision-making scenarios.

This tutorial emphasizes learning by doing, guiding you through the core functionality of GRASS GIS, including data import, preprocessing, and advanced spatial modeling. As an open-source platform, GRASS GIS provides a powerful and flexible environment for ecological analysis, making it an ideal tool for MCA. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a understanding of how to use GRASS GIS for MCA and the confidence to apply these techniques to your own projects.
